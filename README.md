## nrf52 Bootstrap Project

Simple bootstrap of the nrf52 'blinky' example, which allows you to host your code outside of the SDK folder. On Mac or Linux, simply execute setup.sh to download dependencies (nrf SDK, nrf tooling, and GCC ARM). On Windows 10, ensure you have Bash for Windows installed, then run setup.bat.

I've also included a .vscode folder with a task to build & flash to a connected dev kit.
